# comp3431-ass3-worlds

This ROS2 package contains a sample world for assignment 3.
Follow standard ROS2 package installation procedure to use.

Students should be comfortable with building and installing ROS2 packages from source by now. If not,
ask your teammates, tutors or on Webcms.

## Launching the sample house1 world

**house1** is the sample world provided in this package.

```
ros2 launch comp3431_ass3_worlds house1.launch.py
```

## Rooms

There are unique QR codes in all rooms that describe the type of room. For house1, the QR codes in each room are as below.

## Important Note

The launching of the world was done for you in script `turtlebot3_startup.sh` given in assignment1.
The contents of that file are as below:

```
source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setup.bash &&
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch.py &
ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=true
```

Note that the line given to launch the sample house1 world, is a replacement of the second line above.
This means that if you `turtlebot3_startup.sh` after launching the house1 world, you're trying to launch two worlds.
My recommendation would be to add the "setup.bash" line to your bashrc, and add the third cartographer line to a launch file you will write to run all of your nodes in the assignment3.
